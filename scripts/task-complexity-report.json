      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup process into subtasks such as Python installation, package manager setup, directory structure creation, virtual environment initialization, and creation of starter files/scripts for cross-platform compatibility.",
      "reasoning": "This task is foundational but follows standard procedures with minimal decision points. Complexity is moderate due to cross-platform considerations and ensuring all initial files and scripts are correctly set up."

      "taskTitle": "Implement configuration system",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for designing the config schema, implementing the loader class, adding validation, supporting environment overrides, documenting options, and securing sensitive values.",
      "reasoning": "Requires careful design to ensure flexibility, validation, and security. Handling multiple config sources and ensuring robust error handling increases complexity."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for client class creation, endpoint method implementation, error/retry logic, data validation, logging, documentation, and data model creation.",
      "reasoning": "Involves implementing multiple endpoints, robust error handling, data validation, and maintaining clean abstractions. The breadth of API coverage and need for maintainability add to complexity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement MCP client with rate limiting",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for SDK integration, client class design, implementing rate limiting strategies, exponential backoff, usage tracking, logging, and error handling.",
      "reasoning": "Complex due to multiple rate limiting strategies, integration with external APIs, and the need for robust error and quota management. Requires careful design to avoid service disruptions."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for tool definition, handler implementation, schema definition, error/response formatting, tool registration, documentation, and testing.",
      "reasoning": "Requires mapping API endpoints to tool interfaces, defining schemas, and ensuring seamless integration with the MCP server. Testing and documentation are also critical."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for retrieval, batch creation, batch rating, CLI argument parsing, progress tracking, error handling, logging, and rate limit compliance.",
      "reasoning": "Moderately complex due to batch operations, resumability, and integration with rate-limited APIs. Requires robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop automation script for Topics",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for topic retrieval, batch insertion, batch updating, CLI argument parsing, progress tracking, error handling, logging, and rate limit compliance.",
      "reasoning": "Similar to Task 6, complexity arises from batch operations, duplicate avoidance, and robust error handling. Needs to handle large data sets efficiently."
    },

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Develop automation script for News retrieval",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for news retrieval with filters, export functionality, CLI argument parsing, pagination handling, error handling, logging, and rate limit compliance.",
      "reasoning": "Less complex than batch CRUD scripts but still requires careful handling of filters, exports, and pagination. Error handling and rate limit compliance are important."
    },

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Open WebUI integration",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for WebUI installation, configuration, chat command handler development, natural language parsing, help documentation, rate limit integration, user feedback, and startup scripting.",
      "reasoning": "Integration with a third-party UI, natural language processing, and user experience considerations add significant complexity. Requires robust error handling and clear user communication."
